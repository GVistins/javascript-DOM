# DOM Atomic 01: Show One Element

## Questions

---

> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

Your reply here...

It remains hidden because the click event hasn't activated yet, because it has not remained clicked because of the site refresh.

---

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

Your reply here...

It still reveals the text, because what I removed was a function that activates when the page is loaded and just shows the steps to completing the given task.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)

Your reply here...

The "addEventListener" method listens for a specified event in your code and site, and activates when such event transpires.
